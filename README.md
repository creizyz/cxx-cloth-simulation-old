# Cloth Simulation

This project is an archive of a 2015 academic project. This project aimed at simulating cloth physics, and was based on [Bender J., Weberb D., Diziolc R.: Fast and stable cloth simulation based on multi-resolution shape matching. Computers & Graphics 37, 8 (2013), 945â€“954].

The "course-submission-shape-matching.pdf" file was the paper submission of this project for the course. It details the techniques used in the code.
